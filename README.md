 detecting one’s health status with analysis of blood flow captured from a normal video camera

As blood flow under skin reflects one’s health status, my research is about detecting one’s health status with analysis of blood flow captured from a normal video camera. 
Rather than just estimating the heart beat, the data captured is a 2-D image video which is amplified to visualize the blood flow of the whole body. The video is then feed to a CNN for analysing the health status of the user.
