1. how to detect the correct positions of the pulse?
   ->Approach one: hard code the position and draft a window for the user
   ->Approach two: find the sensitive part from the fft data grid.
   
2. About training the data: 
   -> will fft keep all the characteristic of the pulse data(any data lose after fft)
   -> is it good to find some 'golden test case' to initialize the value of neural network?
   
3. What is the quality of the capture of video? compressions?

4. a lot of parameter to tune in order to have a good waveform: 1. buffering size (currenty L=10),
   2. distance of the camera (focal distance)
   3. fps of the camera
   4. nervousness of the user
   5. small movement of the user(very sensitive to change)	
   6. luminosity
   7. shadow in the arm
5. Should a good camera be used for data collection? 

6. What is the difference between the result of human skin and dead objects?
 => The bpm of human skill will increase or decrease smoothly around 1xx Hz after the camera is still for some time,
    while the bpm of dead obj will osccilate from 4x to 1xx even the camera is still after some time(situation can vary a lot)

7. It turns out the measurement of forehead is very stable.
